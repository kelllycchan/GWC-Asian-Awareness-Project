      According to the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, Anit-Asian hate crimes has reached an increase of 149% in the year of 2020. With the surge of COVID-19 cases, the rise in hate crimes and xenophobia towards Asian Americans has left the Asian community triggered and enraged. We need to shed light onto these issues.

    <h3>
      Not only are hate crimes affecting Asian Americans, but the stereotypes and constant instances of culture appropriation are eating away at Asian Americans. Stereotypes like the model minority myth built upon white supremacy puts an image on where all the other minority groups should be headed. It stereotypes all Asians to be rich, pale-skinned, and the better of BIPOC. Asian Americans are slowly not being seen as a minority group and more priveliged. Although white people classify Asians as white-adjacent, they still endure and face racism.
